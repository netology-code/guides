## Fixes

* Do not add “:” after “!” in Twitter text.
* Do not send `title` to Vkontakte (https://github.com/sapegin/social-likes/issues/139).

# 1.0.0 - 2016-04-06

It is the first public release.

The main distinctions between the Social Likes Next and the [Social Likes for jQuery](https://github.com/sapegin/social-likes):

* No jQuery dependency.
* No IE8, IE9 and IE10 support.
* No counters.
* No single button mode.
* No classic skin.
* No Mail.ru button.
* SVG icons (read “Retina support”).
* Light mode of the Flat skin is now a separate Light skin.
* New icons from [Likely](http://ilyabirman.net/projects/likely/) by Ilya Birman.
* Tweaked skins.
* Much cleaner modular ES6 code with tests.

If you don’t use anything like events or dynamic URL update it should work as a drop-in replacement of the Social Likes for jQuery.
